# Verification of Synchronous FIFO
This project implements and verifies a synchronous FIFO coded in SystemVerilog and using UVM. It was built as part of my exploration into advanced verification workflows and timing-sensitive designs.

## Overview
### FIFO:
1. Parameterized FIFO size
2. Empty and Full Flag
3. Assertion Implementation
4. A memory array with read and write pointers
5. Counter to track and drive flag status

### Verification:
1.
